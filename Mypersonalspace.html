      <h1>Personal Details</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">Hello! My name's Emmanuel R. Reyes, you can call me by whatever nickname you want though. I'm coding this website as a performance task for my TLE-ICT class. I've decided to code this over the weekend since that's when I have the most time. </h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">As for my more specific personal details, I am 15 years old in my third year of highschool, or grade 9. I only turned 15 recently on September 12, with my birth-year being 2010. This makes me a Virgo III, which according to the Secret Language of Birthdays, are born between September 11 and 18. This type of Virgo is titled "The Literalist." Along with that, "Virgo III specialize in being able to bring the full power of their thought processes to bear on the situation at hand. However, if their emotional center in disturbed they can be knocked off balance." I find this to be pretty accurate as an emotion-driven person and ENFP as my MBTI.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-text-grey">If it isn't obvious, I really like learning about myself and seeing what things like my birthday mean for my personality and if they're accurate, and seeing what type of thing I am as demonstrated by my interest in Star Signs and MBTI. Although looking at this, it's not my main interest. My main interest comes from creative works, more specifically visual works like drawing, art, movies, etc. ALong with stories despite not being much of reader. I would consider myself one if I actually read books, but in reality, I just like stories in general.</p>

      <h1>Circle of Friends</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">I like to think I have a pretty cool circle of friends! As you can see in the pictures, it may seem like that's all my friends, but I like to consider everyone friendly. I like to think as a lot of people as my friend, but I know how to distinguish them and see who are my friends not in a 'they were fake' kind of way, but rather those I truly connect with.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">If I'm being honest here, I don't really hang out with people that much because sometimes people don't approach me. I don't wanna suddenly intrude on some peoples boundaries and make them uncomfy by just being myself, so that's why I don't approach people that much. With my friends however, it's still sorta similar, but I have more of a feeling that they trust me more, that they enjoy my presence and enjoy me being me. i still don't hang out with people that much ihcluding them since I'm not usually invitied, but it's fine!  I mean, yeah, I do hang out with them from time to time, but it's not that often. They're still my friends either way, and nothing can change that. I trust my friends a lot, even as someone who overthinks and has an anxious attatchment style.</p>

      <h1>My Family</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-8">I'll admit it, my family's not perfect. They've done things to me back then that shaped the person who I am today, good and bad. I thank them for the good parts, and forgive them for the bad parts because they're changing too. They're human too.</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">That's why I don't really get that intimidated by the teachers ir anyone unless they're mad because they're people too. I love my parents—both my biological and teachers—not only just because they're my parents or because I should 'respect' them, but because I care about them. They've done so much for me to excel and be where I am today, and I thank them all for that.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">I love my parents, but that doesn't mean I don't have a sibling—more specifically, a brother. We banter a lot and he's honestly the best worst friend I've ever had. I don't know how else to word it. I don't have any pics of him since I couldn't find any sadly, but just know I care about him a lot too. I wish I had so much more to say about the people who I consider my family, but I don't have anything else to say because I don't think I have any complicated feelings with them. I love them, and they love me. Nothing more; it's simple, and I love it.</p>
