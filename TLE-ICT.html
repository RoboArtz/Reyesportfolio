      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">What I was able to learn from this event literally was how to debate from participation in the ASEAN Debate, placing 4th, but still did my best! How I can apply this in real-life situations is by using my experience in facing and arguing with another person about facts using experience from this and not only this, but past debates and arguments of course.  If I were to teach any of this to a friend or classmate, I'd recommend to have 3 main points and just be smart about how you word yourself and how the other person words their arguments aswell. I'd also likely question why'd they be asking me since I'm not the right person to be asked that kind of stuff since I'm not a debate person. Why'd I join then? Because it was fun! Why it's important for this event to have happened is because it's able to highlight the Filipino subject and A.P. subject aswell in a way. It;s able to bring attention to the clubs of these subjects, bringing in possible new members.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">What I was able to learn in this event was how to play volleyball much more, giving me a larger interest in volleyball as a whole despite not actually playing in the game, the practices were still extremely fun. How I can apply this in real life is either by exploring my interest more and possibly making it larger, or just keeping it as a hobby just for fun! If it wasn't obvious, I was able to participate by joining my teams volleyball team, and actually having fun. If I were to try teaching what I learned from here to a classmate, it'd be through actually playing the game with teaching them proper form along the way. This event is important because it enables the skill within students who like the MAPEH Subject because keeping the passion these students inside through tests or small performance tasks isn't enough for them. It also allows teachers and students alike to enjoy a fun event together aswell.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">What I was able to learn from this event wasn't much, but still some things. The most important thing that I learned here overall in my opinion was how I improved my skills in defending my research paper with the Research Defense performance task being held at the same time as the event if I remember correctly. How I can apply  that in my life and teach it to my classmates is how I also did for the debate in my Buwan ng Wika description; use it to correctly argue against someone else and teach it by telling them to have 3 main points. Overall though, I didn't participate that much or at all in the event because I wasn't really interested in any of the competitions being held for it. This event was still important because it highlighted the Research and Science subject as a whole through this event, which I feel don't get enough love as a science highschool.</h5>

I can use this in real life by possibly educating more people to bring more awareness to the ongoing situation in the West Philippine Sea. How I'd do that is by explaining the simple facts of the situation, how it affects us, etc. The only participation I had in this event was the mandatory seminar/orientation given about the WPS, so outside of that, I didn't really participate that much. The importance of this event was that it was able to highlight the situation of the WPS and bring out the best of the A.P. subject this month through the UN celebration aswell.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">The most important thing I was able to learn from this event was how my section prepares for events like this and how we should appriciate our teachers more for their hard work. How I can apply this in real life is by learning from the mistakes of my section in preparing for an event and improve upon that when I'm in charge of such thing as a person who likes to be as prepared as possible for anything and everything, or would rather do nothing if I can'tâ€”a 0% or 100% type of choices in these kinds of situations since I'm just like that. I can also apply being more appriciative of my teachers in real life aswell by being appreciative of those around me as a whole. I was able to participate in the event by just celebrating our teachers by throwing the party and preparing for them. If I were to give advice to a classmate on what I learned and experienced, I'd just say to just start and get it over with because if you don't, you'll just cram it. It was important to have this event because it gives the teachers of all subjects a chance to be and feel appriciated by their students more and just give them an overall break, even if it's just a day.</h5>

      <h5 class="w3-padding-16">What I was able to learn from this event was how I could support my own school and how I could be more extraverted to people from other schools. I was able to take a selfie with the Talon Dos muse and even interview someone for my groups Basic Journalism Performance Task. I was able to apply what I learned here, and I can continue to apply it by not being afraid to walk up to someone and ask for something like their time. The only type of participation I can say I had in this event was by just taking a few pictures, and that being it. If I were to teach a classmate how to approach someone, I'd recommend to just do it. They're a person too, they're not gonna just be outright mean to you just because you asked for something or anything, and if they are, they weren't worth your time to begin with. It was important for this event to happen because it helped me become more social and it highlighted the Basic Journalism subject, TLE-ICT, and MAPEH once more in just one event from my own experience. It could've highlighted so much more for those who were more active in it to begin with.</h5>
